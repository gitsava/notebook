# About the course curriculum

`PCAP: Programming Essentials in Python` (short form: Python Essentials) is a two-course series that covers all the basics of programming in Python, as well as general computer programming concepts and techniques, and the object-oriented approach.

The Python Essentials course series is divided into two parts:

Python Essentials 1 (PE1): BASICS, consisting of four modules;
  - 1. Introduction to Python and computer programming
  - 2. Data types, variables, basic input-output operations, basic operations
  - 3. Boolean values, conditional execution, loops, lists and list processing, logical nad bitwise operations
  - 4. Functions, tuples, dictionaries, and data processing

Python Essentials 2 (PE2): INTERMEDIATE, consisting of four modules.
  - 1. Modules, packages and PIP
  - 2. Strings, string and list methods, and execeptions
  - 3. Object Oriented Programming in Python
  - 4. Miscellaneous
Each student has access to `hands-on practice materials, labs, quizzes, `and `tests` to learn how to utilize the skills and knowledge gained on the course and interact with some `real-life programming tasks and situations`.

Students who complete the course will be able to accomplish coding tasks related to the basics of programming in the Python language, and to understand the fundamental notions and techniques used in object-oriented programming.
==================================================================================================
Furthermore, they will be ready to attempt the following qualifications:

 - PCEP - Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer (after completing Python Essentials 1)
 - PCAP - Python Certified Associate Programmer (after completing Python Essentials 2)
from the OpenEDG Python Institute.

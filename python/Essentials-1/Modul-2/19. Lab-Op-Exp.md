# Objectives
  - becoming familiar with the concept of numbers, operators and arithmetic operations in Python;
  - understanding the precedence and associativity of Python operators, as well as the proper use of parentheses.

# Scenario
Your task is to complete the code in order to evaluate the following expression:

The result should be assigned to `y`. Be careful - watch the operators and keep their priorities in mind. Don't hesitate to use as many parentheses as you need.

You can use additional variables to shorten the expression (but it's not necessary). Test your code carefully.


# Test Data
```py
x = float(input("Enter value for x: "))
# Write your code here.
print("y =", y)
```
## Sample input: 1

Expected output:
```shell
y = 0.6000000000000001
```
## Sample input: 10

Expected output:
```shell
y = 0.09901951266867294
```

## Sample input: 100
Expected output:
```shell
y = 0.009999000199950014
```

## Sample input: -5
Expected output:
```shell
y = -0.19258202567760344

# Objectives
  - improving the ability to use numbers, operators, and arithmetic operations in Python;
  - using the `print()` function's formatting capabilities;
  - learning to express everyday-life phenomena in terms of programming language.

# Scenario
Your task is to prepare a simple code able to evaluate the `end time` of a period of time, given as a number of minutes (it could be arbitrarily large). The start time is given as a pair of hours (0..23) and minutes (0..59). The result has to be printed to the console.

For example, if an event starts at `12:17` and lasts `59 minutes`, it will end at `13:16`.

Don't worry about any imperfections in your code - it's okay if it accepts an invalid time - the most important thing is that the code produce valid results for valid input data.

Test your code carefully. Hint: using the` % `operator may be the key to success.

# Test Data
```py
hour = int(input("Starting time (hours): "))
mins = int(input("Starting time (minutes): "))
dura = int(input("Event duration (minutes): "))

# Write your code here.

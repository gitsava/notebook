Congratulations! You have completed Module 3.

Well done! You've reached the end of Module 3 and completed a major milestone in your Python programming education. Here's a short summary of the objectives you've covered and got familiar with in Module 3:

  - Boolean values to compare different values and control the execution paths using the `if` and `if-else` instructions;
  - the utilization of loops (`while` and `for`) and how to control their behavior using the `break` and `continue` instructions;
  - the difference between logical and bitwise operations;
  - the concept of lists and list processing, including the iteration provided by the `for` loop, and slicing;
  - the idea of multi-dimensional arrays.

You are now ready to take the module quiz and attempt the final challenge: Module 3 Test, which will help you gauge what you've learned so far.

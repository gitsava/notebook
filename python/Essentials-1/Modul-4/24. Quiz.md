6.  A built-in function is a function which:
    a. has been placed within your code by another programmer
    b. is hidden from programmer
    c. has to be imported before use
    (d). comes with python, and is an intergral part of python

7.  A function defined in the following way: (Select two answars)
```py
def function(x=0):
    return x
```
    - must be invoked with exactly one argument
   (-) must be invoked without any argument
    - may be invoked without any argument
   (-) may be invoked with exactly one argument

8.   Which of the following lines properly starts a function using two parameters, both with zeroed default values?
    (-) def fun(a=0, b=0)
    - def fun(a=b=0)

9.  What is the output of the following snippet?
```py
my_list = ['Mary','had','a','little','lamb']
def my_list(my_list):
    del my_list[3]
    my_list[3] = 'ram'

print(my_list(my_list))
```
    A: no output the snippet is erroneous

10. What is the output of the following snippet?
```py
tup = (1, 2, 3, 4)
tup = tup[1:-1]
tup = tup[0]
print(tup)
```
    A: 2

11. Assuming that my_tuple is a correctly created tuple, the fact that tuples are immutable means that the following instruction:
my_tuple[1] = my_tuple[1] + my_tuple[0]
    a. can be executed if and only if the tuple contains at least two elements
    b. may be illegal if the tuple contains strings
    (c). is illegal
    d. is fully correct

12. What code would you insert instead of the comment to obtain the expected output?
Expected output:
```s
a
b
c
```
Code:
```py
dictionary = {}
my_list = ['a','b','c','d']

for i in range(len(my_list) - 1):
    dictionary[my_list[i]] = (my_list[i], )

for i in sorted(dictionary.keys()):
    k = dictionary[i]
    # insert your code here

print(k[0])
```
    A: print(k[0])

13. Which of the following statements are true? (Select two answers)
    (-) The `None` value can be assigned to variables
    - The `None` value cannot be used outside functions
    (-) The `None` value can be used as an argument of arithmetic operators
    - The `None` value can be compared with variable

14. Which one of the following lines properly starts a parameterless function definition?
    A: def fun():

15. THe fact that tuples belong to sequence types means that:
    A: they can be indexed and sliced like lists

16. What is the output of the following snippet?
```py
def fun(x):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return

print(fun(fun(2)) + 1)
```
    A: the code will couse a runtime error

17. The following snippet:
```py
def func_1(a):
    return a**a

def func_2(a):
    return funct_1(a) * funct_1(a)

print(func_2(2))
```
    A: is erroneous

18. The following snippet:
```py
def func(a, b):
    return a**a

print(func(2))
```
    A: is erroneous

19. What is the output of the following snippet?
```py
dictionary = {'one':'two','three':'one','two':'three'}
v = dictionary['one']

for k in range(len(dictionary)):
    v = dictionary[v]

print(v)
```
    A: two

20. What is the output of the following snippet?
```py
def f(x):
    if x == 0:
        return 0
    return x + f(x - 1)

print(f(3))
```

# Key takeaways

1. A method named `__str__()` is responsible for `converting an object's contents into a (more or less) readable string`. You can redefine it if you want your object to be able to present itself in a more elegant form. For example:
```py
class Mouse:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.my_name = name


    def __str__(self):
        return self.my_name


the_mouse = Mouse('mickey')
print(the_mouse)  # Prints "mickey". 
```

2. A function named `issubclass(Class_1, Class_2)` is able to determine if `Class_1` is a `subclass` of `Class_2`. For example:
```py
class Mouse:
    pass


class LabMouse(Mouse):
    pass


print(issubclass(Mouse, LabMouse), issubclass(LabMouse, Mouse))  # Prints "False True"
```

3. A function named `isinstance(Object, Class)` checks if an object `comes from an indicated class`. For example:
```py
class Mouse:
    pass


class LabMouse(Mouse):
    pass


mickey = Mouse()
print(isinstance(mickey, Mouse), isinstance(mickey, LabMouse))  # Prints "True False".
```

4. A operator called `is` checks if two variables refer to `the same object`. For example:
```py
class Mouse:
    pass


mickey = Mouse()
minnie = Mouse()
cloned_mickey = mickey
print(mickey is minnie, mickey is cloned_mickey)  # Prints "False True".
```

5. A parameterless function named `super()` returns a `reference to the nearest superclass of the class`. For example:
```py
class Mouse:
    def __str__(self):
        return "Mouse"


class LabMouse(Mouse):
    def __str__(self):
        return "Laboratory " + super().__str__()


doctor_mouse = LabMouse();
print(doctor_mouse)  # Prints "Laboratory Mouse".
```

6. Methods as well as instance and class variables defined in a superclass are `automatically inherited` by their subclasses. For example:
```py
class Mouse:
    Population = 0
    def __init__(self, name):
        Mouse.Population += 1
        self.name = name

    def __str__(self):
        return "Hi, my name is " + self.name

class LabMouse(Mouse):
    pass

professor_mouse = LabMouse("Professor Mouser")
print(professor_mouse, Mouse.Population)  # Prints "Hi, my name is Professor Mouser 1"
```

7. In order to find any object/class property, Python looks for it inside:

  - the object itself;
  - all classes involved in the object's inheritance line from bottom to top;
  - if there is more than one class on a particular inheritance path, Python scans them from left to right;
  - if both of the above fail, the `AttributeError` exception is raised.

8. If any of the subclasses defines a method/class variable/instance variable of the same name as existing in the superclass, the new name `overrides` any of the previous instances of the name. For example:
```py
class Mouse:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def __str__(self):
        return "My name is " + self.name

class AncientMouse(Mouse):
    def __str__(self):
        return "Meum nomen est " + self.name

mus = AncientMouse("Caesar")  # Prints "Meum nomen est Caesar"
print(mus)
```

# Exercises
## Scenario

Assume that the following piece of code has been successfully executed:
```py
class Dog:
    kennel = 0
    def __init__(self, breed):
        self.breed = breed
        Dog.kennel += 1
    def __str__(self):
        return self.breed + " says: Woof!"


class SheepDog(Dog):
    def __str__(self):
        return super().__str__() + " Don't run away, Little Lamb!"


class GuardDog(Dog):
    def __str__(self):
        return super().__str__() + " Stay where you are, Mister Intruder!"


rocky = SheepDog("Collie")
luna = GuardDog("Dobermann")
```

Now answer the questions from exercises 1-4.

## Exercise 1
What is the expected output of the following piece of code?
```py
print(rocky)
print(luna)
```
A:
```s
Collie says: Woof! Don't run away, Little Lamb!
Dobermann says: Woof! Stay where you are, Mister Intruder!
```


## Exercise 2
What is the expected output of the following piece of code?
```py
print(issubclass(SheepDog, Dog), issubclass(SheepDog, GuardDog))
print(isinstance(rocky, GuardDog), isinstance(luna, GuardDog))
```
A:
```s
True False
False True
```

## Exercise 3
What is the expected output of the following piece of code?
```py
print(luna is luna, rocky is luna)
print(rocky.kennel)
```
A:
```s
True False
2
```

## Exercise 4
Define a `SheepDog`'s subclass named `LowlandDog`, and equip it with an `__str__()` method overriding an inherited method of the same name. The new dog's `__str__()` method should return the string "Woof! I don't like mountains!" .
A:
```py
class LowlandDog(SheepDog):
	def __str__(self):
		return Dog.__str__(self) + " I don't like mountains!"
```

# What is a stack?
`A stack is a structure developed to store data in a very specific way`. Imagine a stack of coins. You aren't able to put a coin anywhere else but on the top of the stack.

Similarly, you can't get a coin off the stack from any place other than the top of the stack. If you want to get the coin that lies on the bottom, you have to remove all the coins from the higher levels.

The alternative name for a stack (but only in IT terminology) is `LIFO`.

It's an abbreviation for a very clear description of the stack's behavior: `Last In - First Out`. The coin that came last onto the stack will leave first.

`A stack is an object` with two elementary operations, conventionally named `push` (when a new element is put on the top) and `pop` (when an existing element is taken away from the top).

Stacks are used very often in many classical algorithms, and it's hard to imagine the implementation of many widely used tools without the use of stacks.

Let's implement a stack in Python. This will be a very simple stack, and we'll show you how to do it in two independent approaches: procedural and objective.

Let's start with the first one.

========================================================================
# The stack - the procedural approach
First, you have to decide how to store the values which will arrive onto the stack. We suggest using the simplest of methods, and `employing a list` for this job. Let's assume that the size of the stack is not limited in any way. Let's also assume that the last element of the list stores the top element.

The stack itself is already created:
```py
stack = []
```

We're ready to `define a function that puts a value onto the stack`. Here are the presuppositions for it:

  - the name for the function is `push`;
  - the function gets one parameter (this is the value to be put onto the stack)
  - the function returns nothing;
  - the function appends the parameter's value to the end of the stack;

This is how we've done it - take a look:
```py
def push(val):
    stack.append(val)
```

Now it's time for a `function to take a value off the stack`. This is how you can do it:

  - the name of the function is pop;
  - the function doesn't get any parameters;
  - the function returns the value taken from the stack
  - the function reads the value from the top of the stack and removes it.

The function is here:
```py
def pop():
    val = stack[-1]
    del stack[-1]
    return val
```

Note: the function doesn't check if there is any element in the stack.

Let's assemble all the pieces together to set the stack in motion. The `complete program` pushes three numbers onto the stack, pulls them off, and prints their values on the screen. You can see it in the editor window.

The program outputs the following text to the screen:
```s
1
2
3
```

Test it.
```py
stack = []


def push(val):
    stack.append(val)


def pop():
    val = stack[-1]
    del stack[-1]
    return val


push(3)
push(2)
push(1)

print(pop())
print(pop())
print(pop())
```

========================================================================
# The stack - the procedural approach vs. the object-oriented approach
The procedural stack is ready. Of course, there are some weaknesses, and the implementation could be improved in many ways (harnessing exceptions to work is a good idea), but in general the stack is fully implemented, and you can use it if you need to.

But the more often you use it, the more disadvantages you'll encounter. Here are some of them:

  - the essential variable (the stack list) is highly vulnerable; anyone can modify it in an uncontrollable way, destroying the stack, in effect; this doesn't mean that it's been done maliciously - on the contrary, it may happen as a result of carelessness, e.g., when somebody confuses variable names; imagine that you have accidentally written something like this:
   ```py
   stack[0] = 0
   ```

   The functioning of the stack will be completely disorganized;

  - it may also happen that one day you need more than one stack; you'll have to create another list for the stack's storage, and probably other `push` and `pop` functions too;

  - it may also happen that you need not only `push` and `pop` functions, but also some other conveniences; you could certainly implement them, but try to imagine what would happen if you had dozens of separately implemented stacks.

The objective approach delivers solutions for each of the above problems. Let's name them first:

  - the ability to hide (protect) selected values against unauthorized access is called `encapsulation; the encapsulated values can be neither accessed nor modified if you want to use them exclusively`;

  - when you have a class implementing all the needed stack behaviors, you can produce as many stacks as you want; you needn't copy or replicate any part of the code;

  - the ability to enrich the stack with new functions comes from inheritance; you can create a new class (a subclass) which inherits all the existing traits from the superclass, and adds some new ones.

Let's now write a brand new stack implementation from scratch. This time, we'll use the objective approach, guiding you step by step into the world of object programming.

========================================================================
# The stack - the object approach
Of course, the main idea remains the same. We'll use a list as the stack's storage. We only have to know how to put the list into the class.

Let's start from the absolute beginning - this is how the objective stack begins:
```py
class Stack:
```

Now, we expect two things from it:

  - we want the class to have `one property as the stack's storage` - we have to `"install" a list inside each object of the class` (note: each object has to have its own list - the list mustn't be shared among different stacks)
  - then, we want `the list to be hidden` from the class users' sight.

How is this done?

In contrast to other programming languages, Python has no means of allowing you to declare such a property just like that.

Instead, you need to add a specific statement or instruction. The properties have to be added to the class manually.

How do you guarantee that such an activity takes place every time the new stack is created?

There is a simple way to do it - you have to `equip the class with a specific function` - its specificity is dual:

  - it has to be named in a strict way;
  - it is invoked implicitly, when the new object is created.

Such a function is called a `constructor`, as its general purpose is to `construct a new object`. The constructor should know everything about the object's structure, and must perform all the needed initializations.

Let's add a very simple constructor to the new class. Take a look at the snippet:
```py
class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        print("Hi!")


stack_object = Stack()
```

And now:

  - the constructor's name is always `__init__`;
  - it has to have `at least one parameter` (we'll discuss this later); the parameter is used to represent the newly created object - you can use the parameter to manipulate the object, and to enrich it with the needed properties; you'll make use of this soon;
  - note: the obligatory parameter is usually named `self` - it's only `a convention, but you should follow it` - it simplifies the process of reading and understanding your code.

The code is in the editor. Run it now.

Here is its output:
```s
Hi!
```

Note - there is no trace of invoking the constructor inside the code. It has been invoked implicitly and automatically. Let's make use of that now.

# Key takeaways

1. A method is a function embedded inside a class. The first (or only) parameter of each method is usually named `self`, which is designed to identify the object for which the method is invoked in order to access the object's properties or invoke its methods.


2. If a class contains a `constructor` (a method named `__init__`) it cannot return any value and cannot be invoked directly.


3. All classes (but not objects) contain a property named `__name__`, which stores the name of the class. Additionally, a property named `__module__` stores the name of the module in which the class has been declared, while the property named `__bases__` is a tuple containing a class's superclasses.

For example:
```py
class Sample:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = Sample.__name__
    def myself(self):
        print("My name is " + self.name + " living in a " + Sample.__module__)


obj = Sample()
obj.myself()
```

The code outputs:
```s
My name is Sample living in a __main__
```

## Exercise 1
The declaration of the `Snake` class is given below. Enrich the class with a method named `increment()`, adding `1` to the `__victims` property.
```py
class Snake:
    def __init__(self):
        self.victims = 0
```
A: 
```py
class Snake:
    def __init__(self):
        self.victims = 0

    def increment(self):
        self.victims += 1
```

## Exercise 2
Redefine the `Snake` class constructor so that is has a parameter to initialize the `victims` field with a value passed to the object during construction.
A: 
```py
class Snake:
    def __init__(self, victims):
        self.victims = victims	
```

## Exercise 3
Can you predict the output of the following code?
```py
class Snake:
    pass


class Python(Snake):
    pass


print(Python.__name__, 'is a', Snake.__name__)
print(Python.__bases__[0].__name__, 'can be', Python.__name__)
```
A:
```s
Python is a Snake
Snake can be Python
```

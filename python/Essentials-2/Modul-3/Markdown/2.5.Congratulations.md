# Congratulations! You have completed PE2: Module 3.

Well done! You've reached the end of Module 3 and completed a major milestone in your Python programming education. Here's a short summary of the objectives you've covered and got familiar with in Module 3:

  - the foundations and basic concepts of object-oriented programming;
  - the differences between the procedural and object approaches on the example of the stack;
  - properties (instance and class variables, attributes)
  - methods (class and object methods, the constructor, parameters, and properties)
  - the concept of inheritance (functions, methods, class hierarchies, polymorphism, composition, single vs. multiple inheritance)
  - the objective nature of Python exceptions.

You are now ready to take the module quiz and attempt the final challenge: Module 3 Test, which will help you gauge what you've learned so far.

# Key takeaways

1. You can use the `sort()` method to sort elements of a list, e.g.:
```py
lst = [5, 3, 1, 2, 4]
print(lst)

lst.sort()
print(lst)  # outputs: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

2. There is also a list method called reverse(), which you can use to reverse the list, e.g.:
```py
lst = [5, 3, 1, 2, 4]
print(lst)

lst.reverse()
print(lst)  # outputs: [4, 2, 1, 3, 5]
```
## Exercise 1
What is the output of the following snippet?
```py
lst = ["D", "F", "A", "Z"]
lst.sort()

print(lst)
```

A: ['A', 'D', 'F', 'Z']

## Exercise 2
What is the output of the following snippet?
```py
a = 3
b = 1
c = 2

lst = [a, c, b]
lst.sort()

print(lst)
```

A: [1, 2, 3]

## Exercise 3
What is the output of the following snippet?
```py
a = "A"
b = "B"
c = "C"
d = " "

lst = [a, b, c, d]
lst.reverse()

print(lst)
```

A: [' ', 'C', 'B', 'A']

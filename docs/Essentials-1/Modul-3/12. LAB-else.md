## Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

  - using the `while` loop;
  - finding the proper implementation of verbally defined rules;
  - reflecting real-life situations in computer code.

## Scenario
Listen to this story: a boy and his father, a computer programmer, are playing with wooden blocks. They are building a pyramid.

Their pyramid is a bit weird, as it is actually a pyramid-shaped wall - it's flat. The pyramid is stacked according to one simple principle: each lower layer contains one block more than the layer above.

The figure illustrates the rule used by the builders:
    .....
    |   |
 |''''|''''|
 """""""""""

Your task is to write a program which reads the number of blocks the builders have, and outputs the height of the pyramid that can be built using these blocks.

Note: the height is measured by the number of `fully completed layers` - if the builders don't have a sufficient number of blocks and cannot complete the next layer, they finish their work immediately.

Test your code using the data we've provided.
```py
blocks = int(input("Enter the number of blocks: "))

#
# Write your code here.
#	

print("The height of the pyramid:", height)
```

## Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

  - using the while loop;
  - converting verbally defined loops into actual Python code.

## Scenario
In 1937, a German mathematician named Lothar Collatz formulated an intriguing hypothesis (it still remains unproven) which can be described in the following way:

 1. take any non-negative and non-zero integer number and name it `c0`;
 2. if it's even, evaluate a new `c0` as `c0 ÷ 2`;
 3. otherwise, if it's odd, evaluate a new `c0` as `3 × c0 + 1`;
 4. if `c0 ≠ 1`, skip to point 2.

The hypothesis says that regardless of the initial value of `c0`, it will always go to 1.

Of course, it's an extremely complex task to use a computer in order to prove the hypothesis for any natural number (it may even require artificial intelligence), but you can use Python to check some individual numbers. Maybe you'll even find the one which would disprove the hypothesis.


Write a program which reads one natural number and executes the above steps as long as `c0` remains different from 1. We also want you to count the steps needed to achieve the goal. Your code should output all the intermediate values of `c0`, too.

Hint: the most important part of the problem is how to transform Collatz's idea into a while loop - this is the key to success.

Test your code using the data we've provided.

# LAB
## Estimated time
10-20 minutes

## Level of difficulty
Easy

## Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

  - using the `break` statement in loops;
  - reflecting real-life situations in computer code.

## Scenario
The `break` statement is used to exit/terminate a loop.

Design a program that uses a `while` loop and continuously asks the user to enter a word unless the user enters `"chupacabra"` as the secret exit word, in which case the message `"You've successfully left the loop."` should be printed to the screen, and the loop should terminate.

Don't print any of the words entered by the user. Use the concept of conditional execution and the `break` statement.

# LAB
## Estimated time
10-20 minutes

## Level of difficulty
Easy

## Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

  - using the `continue` statement in loops;
  - reflecting real-life situations in computer code.

## Scenario
The `continue` statement is used to skip the current block and move ahead to the next iteration, without executing the statements inside the loop.

It can be used with both the while and for loops.

Your task here is very special: you must design a vowel eater! Write a program that uses:

  - a for loop;
  - the concept of conditional execution (if-elif-else)
  - the continue statement.

Your program must:

  - ask the user to enter a word;
  - use `user_word = user_word.upper()` to convert the word entered by the user to upper case; we'll talk about the so-called `string methods` and the `upper()` method very soon - don't worry;
  - use conditional execution and the `continue` statement to "eat" the following vowels A, E, I, O, U from the inputted word;
  - print the uneaten letters to the screen, each one of them on a separate line.

Test your program with the data we've provided for you.
```py
# Prompt the user to enter a word
# and assign it to the user_word variable.

for letter in user_word:
    # Complete the body of the for loop.
```

# LAB
## Estimated time
5-15 minutes

## Level of difficulty
Easy

## Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

  - using the `continue` statement in loops;
  - modifying and upgrading the existing code;
  - reflecting real-life situations in computer code.

## Scenario
Your task here is even more special than before: you must redesign the (ugly) vowel eater from the previous lab (3.1.2.10) and create a better, upgraded (pretty) vowel eater! Write a program that uses:

  - a `for` loop;
  - the concept of conditional execution (if-elif-else)
  - the `continue` statement.

Your program must:

  - ask the user to enter a word;
  - use `user_word = user_word.upper()` to convert the word entered by the user to upper case; we'll talk about the so-called `string methods` and the `upper()` method very soon - don't worry;
  - use conditional execution and the `continue` statement to "eat" the following vowels A, E, I, O, U from the inputted word;
  - assign the uneaten letters to the `word_without_vowels` variable and print the variable to the screen.

Look at the code in the editor. We've created `word_without_vowels` and assigned an empty string to it. Use concatenation operation to ask Python to combine selected letters into a longer string during subsequent loop turns, and assign it to the `word_without_vowels` variable.

Test your program with the data we've provided for you.
```py
word_without_vowels = ""

# Prompt the user to enter a word
# and assign it to the user_word variable.


for letter in user_word:
    # Complete the body of the loop.

# Print the word assigned to word_without_vowels.
```

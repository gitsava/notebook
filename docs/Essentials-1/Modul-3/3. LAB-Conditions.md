  - becoming familiar with the concept of conditional execution.
## Scenario
`Spathiphyllum`, more commonly known as a peace lily or white sail plant, is one of the most popular indoor houseplants that filters out harmful toxins from the air. Some of the toxins that it neutralizes include benzene, formaldehyde, and ammonia.

Imagine that your computer program loves these plants. Whenever it receives an input in the form of the word `Spathiphyllum`, it involuntarily shouts to the console the following string: `"Spathiphyllum is the best plant ever!"`

Write a program that utilizes the concept of conditional execution, takes a string as input, and:

  - prints the sentence `"Yes - Spathiphyllum is the best plant ever!"` to the screen if the inputted string is `"Spathiphyllum"` (upper-case)
  - prints `"No, I want a big Spathiphyllum!"` if the inputted string is `"spathiphyllum"` (lower-case)
  - prints `"Spathiphyllum! Not [input]!"` otherwise. Note: `[input]` is the string taken as input.

Test your code using the data we've provided for you. And get yourself a Spathiphyllum, too!

## Test Data
Sample input: `spathiphyllum`

Expected output: `No, I want a big Spathiphyllum!`

Sample input: `pelargonium`

Expected output: `Spathiphyllum! Not pelargonium!`

Sample input: `Spathiphyllum`

Expected output: `Yes - Spathiphyllum is the best plant ever!`

## Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

  - using the if-else instruction to branch the control path;
  - building a complete program that solves simple real-life problems.

## Scenario
Once upon a time there was a land - a land of milk and honey, inhabited by happy and prosperous people. The people paid taxes, of course - their happiness had limits. The most important tax, called the Personal Income Tax (PIT for short) had to be paid once a year, and was evaluated using the following rule:

  - if the citizen's income was not higher than 85,528 thalers, the tax was equal to 18% of the income minus 556 thalers and 2 cents (this was the so-called tax relief)
  - if the income was higher than this amount, the tax was equal to 14,839 thalers and 2 cents, plus 32% of the surplus over 85,528 thalers.

Your task is to write a `tax calculator`.

  - It should accept one floating-point value: the income.
  - Next, it should print the calculated tax, rounded to full thalers. There's a function named `round()` which will do the rounding for you - you'll find it in the skeleton code in the editor.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Note: this happy country never returns money to its citizens. If the calculated tax is less than zero, it only means no tax at all (the tax is equal to zero). Take this into consideration during your calculations.

Look at the code in the editor - it only reads one input value and outputs a result, so you need to complete it with some smart calculations.

Test your code using the data we've provided.
```py
income = float(input("Enter the annual income: "))

#
# Write your code here.
#

tax = round(tax, 0)
print("The tax is:", tax, "thalers")
```
# Test Data
==========================================
Sample input: 10000

Expected output: The tax is: 1244.0 thalers
==========================================
Sample input: 100000

Expected output: The tax is: 19470.0 thalers
==========================================
Sample input: 1000

Expected output: The tax is: 0.0 thalers
==========================================
Sample input: -100

Expected output: The tax is: 0.0 thalers

## Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

  - using the if-elif-else statement;
  - finding the proper implementation of verbally defined rules;
  - testing code using sample input and output.

## Scenario
As you surely know, due to some astronomical reasons, years may be leap or common. The former are 366 days long, while the latter are 365 days long.

Since the introduction of the Gregorian calendar (in 1582), the following rule is used to determine the kind of year:

  - if the year number isn't divisible by four, it's a common year;
  - otherwise, if the year number isn't divisible by 100, it's a leap year;
  - otherwise, if the year number isn't divisible by 400, it's a common year;
  - otherwise, it's a leap year.
Look at the code in the editor - it only reads a year number, and needs to be completed with the instructions implementing the test we've just described.

The code should output one of two possible messages, which are `Leap year` or `Common year`, depending on the value entered.

It would be good to verify if the entered year falls into the Gregorian era, and output a warning otherwise: `Not within the Gregorian calendar period`. Tip: use the `!=` and `%` operators.

Test your code using the data we've provided.
```py
year = int(input("Enter a year: "))

#
# Write your code here.
#	
```

# Test Data
Sample input: 2000

Expected output: Leap year
========================================
Sample input: 2015

Expected output: Common year
========================================
Sample input: 1999

Expected output: Common year
========================================
Sample input: 1996

Expected output: Leap year
========================================
Sample input: 1580

Expected output: Not within the Gregorian calendar period

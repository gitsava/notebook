# Some simple functions: recursion
There's one more thing we want to show you to make everything complete - it's `recursion`.

This term may describe many different concepts, but one of them is especially interesting - the one referring to computer programming.

In this field, recursion is a `technique where a function invokes itself`.

These two cases seem to be the best to illustrate the phenomenon - factorials and Fibonacci numbers. Especially the latter.

`The Fibonacci numbers definition is a clear example of recursion`. We already told you that:

The definition of the ith number refers to the i-1 number, and so on, till you reach the first two.

Can it be used in the code? Yes, it can. It can also make the code shorter and clearer.

The second version of our `fib()` function makes direct use of this definition:
```py
def fib(n):
    if n < 1:
        return None
    if n < 3:
        return 1
    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
```

The code is much clearer now.

But is it really safe? Does it entail any risk?

Yes, there is a little risk indeed. `If you forget to consider the conditions which can stop the chain of recursive invocations, the program may enter an infinite loop`. You have to be careful.

The factorial has a second, `recursive` side too. Look:
```
n! = 1 × 2 × 3 × ... × n-1 × n
```

It's obvious that:
```
1 × 2 × 3 × ... × n-1 = (n-1)!
```

So, finally, the result is:
```
n! = (n-1)! × n
```
This is in fact a ready recipe for our new solution.


Here it is:
```py
def factorial_function(n):
    if n < 0:
        return None
    if n < 2:
        return 1
    return n * factorial_function(n - 1)
```

Does it work? Yes, it does. Try it for yourself.

Our short functional journey is almost over. The next section will take care of two curious Python data types: tuples and dictionaries.
```py
def fib(n):
    if n < 1:
         return None
    if n < 3:
        return 1

    elem_1 = elem_2 = 1
    the_sum = 0
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        the_sum = elem_1 + elem_2
        elem_1, elem_2 = elem_2, the_sum
    return the_sum


for n in range(1, 10):
    print(n, "->", fib(n))
```

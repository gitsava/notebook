# LAB
## Estimated time
10-15 minutes

## Level of difficulty
Easy

## Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

  - projecting and writing parameterized functions;
  - utilizing the return statement;
  - testing the functions.

## Scenario
Your task is to write and test a function which takes one argument (a year) and returns `True` if the year is a leap year, or `False` otherwise.

The seed of the function is already sown in the skeleton code in the editor.

Note: we've also prepared a short testing code, which you can use to test your function.

The code uses two lists - one with the test data, and the other containing the expected results. The code will tell you if any of your results are invalid.

```py
def is_year_leap(year):
#
# put your code here
#

test_data = [1900, 2000, 2016, 1987]
test_results = [False, True, True, False]
for i in range(len(test_data)):
	yr = test_data[i]
	print(yr,"->",end="")
	result = is_year_leap(yr)
	if result == test_results[i]:
		print("OK")
	else:
		print("Failed")
```
```s

    test_data = [1900, 2000, 2016, 1987]

## Prerequisites
LAB 4.3.1.6

## Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

  - projecting and writing parameterized functions;
  - utilizing the return statement;
  - utilizing the student's own functions.

## Scenario
Your task is to write and test a function which takes two arguments (a year and a month) and returns the number of days for the given month/year pair (while only February is sensitive to the `year` value, your function should be universal).

The initial part of the function is ready. Now, convince the function to return `None` if its arguments don't make sense.

Of course, you can (and should) use the previously written and tested function (LAB 4.3.1.6). It may be very helpful. We encourage you to use a list filled with the months' lengths. You can create it inside the function - this trick will significantly shorten the code.

We've prepared a testing code. Expand it to include more test cases.
```py
def is_year_leap(year):
#
# Your code from LAB 4.3.1.6.
#

def days_in_month(year, month):
#
# Write your new code here.
#

test_years = [1900, 2000, 2016, 1987]
test_months = [2, 2, 1, 11]
test_results = [28, 29, 31, 30]
for i in range(len(test_years)):
	yr = test_years[i]
	mo = test_months[i]
	print(yr, mo, "->", end="")
	result = days_in_month(yr, mo)
	if result == test_results[i]:
		print("OK")
	else:
		print("Failed")

## Prerequisites

LAB 4.3.1.7

## Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

  - projecting and writing parameterized functions;
  - utilizing the return statement;
  - building a set of utility functions;
  - utilizing the student's own functions.

## Scenario
Your task is to write and test a function which takes three arguments (a year, a month, and a day of the month) and returns the corresponding day of the year, or returns `None` if any of the arguments is invalid.

Use the previously written and tested functions. Add some test cases to the code. This test is only a beginning.
```py
def is_year_leap(year):
#
# Your code from LAB 4.3.1.6.
#

def days_in_month(year, month):
#
# Your code from LAB 4.3.1.7.
#

def day_of_year(year, month, day):
#
# Write your new code here.
#

print(day_of_year(2000, 12, 31))

```

## Objectives
  - familiarizing the student with classic notions and algorithms;
  - improving the student's skills in defining and using functions.

## Scenario
A natural number is `prime` if it is greater than 1 and has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

Complicated? Not at all. For example, 8 isn't a prime number, as you can divide it by 2 and 4 (we can't use divisors equal to 1 and 8, as the definition prohibits this).

On the other hand, 7 is a prime number, as we can't find any legal divisors for it.


Your task is to write a function checking whether a number is prime or not.

The function:

  - is called `is_prime`;
  - takes one argument (the value to check)
  - returns `True` if the argument is a prime number, and `False` otherwise.

Hint: try to divide the argument by all subsequent values (starting from 2) and check the remainder - if it's zero, your number cannot be a prime; think carefully about when you should stop the process.

If you need to know the square root of any value, you can utilize the ** operator. Remember: the square root of x is the same as x0.5

Complete the code in the editor.
```py
def is_prime(num):
#
# Write your code here.
#

for i in range(1, 20):
	if is_prime(i + 1):
			print(i + 1, end=" ")
print()
```
Run your code and check whether your output is the same as ours.

## Expected output
```s

Scenario
A car's fuel consumption may be expressed in many different ways. For example, in Europe, it is shown as the amount of fuel consumed per 100 kilometers.

In the USA, it is shown as the number of miles traveled by a car using one gallon of fuel.

Your task is to write a pair of functions converting l/100km into mpg, and vice versa.

The functions:

  - are named `liters_100km_to_miles_gallon` and `miles_gallon_to_liters_100km` respectively;
  - take one argument (the value corresponding to their names)

Complete the code in the editor.
```py
def liters_100km_to_miles_gallon(liters):
#
# Write your code here.
#

def miles_gallon_to_liters_100km(miles):
#
# Write your code here
#

print(liters_100km_to_miles_gallon(3.9))
print(liters_100km_to_miles_gallon(7.5))
print(liters_100km_to_miles_gallon(10.))
print(miles_gallon_to_liters_100km(60.3))
print(miles_gallon_to_liters_100km(31.4))
print(miles_gallon_to_liters_100km(23.5))
```
Run your code and check whether your output is the same as ours.

Here is some information to help you:

  - 1 American mile = 1609.344 metres;
  - 1 American gallon = 3.785411784 litres.

# Key takeaways
1. A function can call other functions or even itself. When a function calls itself, this situation is known as `recursion`, and the function which calls itself and contains a specified termination condition (i.e., the base case - a condition which doesn't tell the function to make any further calls to that function) is called a `recursive` function.

2. You can use recursive functions in Python to write `clean`, `elegant code, and divide it into smaller, organized chunks`. On the other hand, you need to be very careful as it might be `easy to make a mistake and create a function which never terminates`. You also need to remember that `recursive calls consume a lot of memory`, and therefore may sometimes be inefficient.

When using recursion, you need to take all its advantages and disadvantages into consideration.

The factorial function is a classic example of how the concept of recursion can be put in practice:
```py
# Recursive implementation of the factorial function.

def factorial(n):
    if n == 1:    # The base case (termination condition.)
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)


print(factorial(4)) # 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24
```

## Exercise 1
What will happen when you attempt to run the following snippet and why?
```py
def factorial(n):
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

print(factorial(4))
```
A: The factorial function has no termination condition (no base case) so Python will raise an exception (`RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded`)

## Exercise 2
What is the output of the following snippet?
```py
def fun(a):
    if a > 30:
        return 3
    else:
        return a + fun(a + 3)

print(fun(25))
```

# What is a dictionary?
The `dictionary` is another Python data structure. It's `not a sequence` type (but can be easily adapted to sequence processing) and it is `mutable`.

To explain what the Python dictionary actually is, it is important to understand that it is literally a dictionary.

The Python dictionary works in the same way as `a bilingual dictionary`. For example, you have an English word (e.g., cat) and need its French equivalent. You browse the dictionary in order to find the word (you may use different techniques to do that - it doesn't matter) and eventually you get it. Next, you check the French counterpart and it is (most probably) the word "chat".

In Python's world, the word you look for is named a `key`. The word you get from the dictionary is called a `value`.

This means that a dictionary is a set of `key-value` pairs. Note:

  - each key must be `unique` - it's not possible to have more than one key of the same value;
  - a key may be `any immutable type of object`: it can be a number (integer or float), or even a string, but not a list;
  - a dictionary is not a list - a list contains a set of numbered values, while a `dictionary holds pairs of values`;
  - the `len()` function works for dictionaries, too - it returns the numbers of key-value elements in the dictionary;
  - a dictionary is a `one-way tool` - if you have an English-French dictionary, you can look for French equivalents of English terms, but not vice versa.

Now we can show you some working examples.

# How to make a dictionary?
If you want to assign some initial pairs to a dictionary, you should use the following syntax:
```py
dictionary = {"cat": "chat", "dog": "chien", "horse": "cheval"}
phone_numbers = {'boss': 5551234567, 'Suzy': 22657854310}
empty_dictionary = {}

print(dictionary)
print(phone_numbers)
print(empty_dictionary)
```

In the first example, the dictionary uses keys and values which are both strings. In the second one, the keys are strings, but the values are integers. The reverse layout (keys → numbers, values → strings) is also possible, as well as number-number combination.

The list of pairs is `surrounded by curly braces`, while the pairs themselves are `separated by commas`, and the `keys and values by colons`.

The first of our dictionaries is a very simple English-French dictionary. The second - a very tiny telephone directory.

The empty dictionaries are constructed by an `empty pair of curly braces` - nothing unusual.


The dictionary as a whole can be printed with a single `print()` invocation. The snippet `may` produce the following output:
```s
{'dog': 'chien', 'horse': 'cheval', 'cat': 'chat'}
{'Suzy': 5557654321, 'boss': 5551234567}
{}
```
output


Have you noticed anything surprising? The order of the printed pairs is different than in the initial assignment. What does that mean?

First of all, it's a confirmation that `dictionaries are not lists` - they don't preserve the order of their data, as the order is completely meaningless (unlike in real, paper dictionaries). The order in which a dictionary `stores its data is completely out of your control`, and your expectations. That's normal. (*)

## NOTE

(*) In Python 3.6x dictionaries have become `ordered` collections by default. Your results may vary depending on what Python version you're using.

# How to use a dictionary?
If you want to get any of the values, you have to deliver a valid key value:
```py
print(dictionary['cat'])
print(phone_numbers['Suzy'])
```

Getting a dictionary's value resembles indexing, especially thanks to the brackets surrounding the key's value.

Note:

  - if the key is a string, you have to specify it as a string;
  - `keys are case-sensitive: 'Suzy'` is something different from `'suzy'`.

The snippet outputs two lines of text:
```py
dictionary = {"cat": "chat", "dog": "chien", "horse": "cheval"}
phone_numbers = {'boss' : 5551234567, 'Suzy' : 22657854310}
empty_dictionary = {}

# Print the values here.
```
```s
chat
5557654321
```
output


And now the most important news: `you mustn't use a non-existent key`. Trying something like this:
```py
print(phone_numbers['president'])
```

will cause a runtime error. Try to do it.

Fortunately, there's a simple way to avoid such a situation. The `in` operator, together with its companion, `not in`, can salvage this situation.

The following code safely searches for some French words:
```py
dictionary = {"cat": "chat", "dog": "chien", "horse": "cheval"}
words = ['cat', 'lion', 'horse']

for word in words:
    if word in dictionary:
        print(word, "->", dictionary[word])
    else:
        print(word, "is not in dictionary")
```

The code's output looks as follows:
```s
cat -> chat
lion is not in dictionary
horse -> cheval
```
output

## NOTE

When you write a big or lengthy expression, it may be a good idea to keep it vertically aligned. This is how you can make your code more readable and more programmer-friendly, e.g.:
```py
# Example 1:
dictionary = {
              "cat": "chat",
              "dog": "chien",
              "horse": "cheval"
              }

# Example 2:
phone_numbers = {'boss': 5551234567,
                 'Suzy': 22657854310
                 }
```

Such ways of formatting code are called `hanging indents`.

=================================================================================
# How to use a dictionary: the keys()
Can dictionaries be `browsed` using the `for` loop, like lists or tuples?

No and yes.

No, because a dictionary is `not a sequence type` - the `for` loop is useless with it.

Yes, because there are simple and very effective tools that can `adapt any dictionary to the for loop requirements` (in other words, building an intermediate link between the dictionary and a temporary sequence entity).

The first of them is a method named `keys()`, possessed by each dictionary. The method `returns an iterable object consisting of all the keys gathered within the dictionary`. Having a group of keys enables you to access the whole dictionary in an easy and handy way.

Just like here:
```py
dictionary = {"cat": "chat", "dog": "chien", "horse": "cheval"}

for key in dictionary.keys():
    print(key, "->", dictionary[key]
```

The code's output looks as follows:
```s
horse -> cheval
dog -> chien
cat -> chat
```
output


# The sorted() function
```py
dictionary = {"cat": "chat", "dog": "chien", "horse": "cheval"}

for key in dictionary.keys():
    print(key, "->", dictionary[key])
```
Do you want it sorted? Just enrich the for loop to get such a form:
```
for key in sorted(dictionary.keys()):
```

The `sorted()` function will do its best - the output will look like this:
```s
cat -> chat
dog -> chien
horse -> cheval
```
output

=================================================================================
# How to use a dictionary: The items() and values() methods
Another way is based on using a dictionary's method named `items()`. The method `returns tuples` (this is the first example where tuples are something more than just an example of themselves) `where each tuple is a key-value pair`.

This is how it works:
```py
dictionary = {"cat": "chat", "dog": "chien", "horse": "cheval"}

for english, french in dictionary.items():
    print(english, "->", french)
```

Note the way in which the tuple has been used as a for loop variable.
```py
dictionary = {"cat": "chat", "dog": "chien", "horse": "cheval"}

for english, french in dictionary.items():
    print(english, "->", french)
```
The example prints:
```s
cat -> chat
dog -> chien
horse -> cheval
```
output

There is also a method named `values()`, which works similarly to `keys()`, but `returns values`.

Here is a simple example:
```py
dictionary = {"cat": "chat", "dog": "chien", "horse": "cheval"}

for french in dictionary.values():
    print(french)
```

As the dictionary is not able to automatically find a key for a given value, the role of this method is rather limited.

Here is the expected output:
```s
cheval
chien
chat
```
output

=================================================================================
# How to use a dictionary: modifying and adding values
Assigning a new value to an existing key is simple - as dictionaries are fully `mutable`, there are no obstacles to modifying them.

We're going to replace the value `"chat"` with `"minou"`, which is not very accurate, but it will work well with our example.

Look:
```py
dictionary = {"cat": "chat", "dog": "chien", "horse": "cheval"}

dictionary['cat'] = 'minou'
print(dictionary)
```

The output is:
```s
{'cat': 'minou', 'dog': 'chien', 'horse': 'cheval'}
```
output

# Adding a new key
Adding a new key-value pair to a dictionary is as simple as changing a value - you only have to assign a value to a new, `previously non-existent key`.

Note: this is very different behavior compared to lists, which don't allow you to assign values to non-existing indices.

Let's add a new pair of words to the dictionary - a bit weird, but still valid:
```py
dictionary = {"cat": "chat", "dog": "chien", "horse": "cheval"}

dictionary['swan'] = 'cygne'
print(dictionary)
```

The example outputs:
```s
{'cat': 'chat', 'dog': 'chien', 'horse': 'cheval', 'swan': 'cygne'}
```
output

## EXTRA

You can also insert an item to a dictionary by using the `update()` method, e.g.:
```py
dictionary = {"cat": "chat", "dog": "chien", "horse": "cheval"}

dictionary.update({"duck": "canard"})
print(dictionary)
```

# Removing a key
Can you guess how to remove a key from a dictionary?

Note: removing a key will always cause the `removal of the associated value. Values cannot exist without their keys`.

This is done with the `del` instruction.

Here's the example:
```py
dictionary = {"cat": "chat", "dog": "chien", "horse": "cheval"}

del dictionary['dog']
print(dictionary)
```

Note: `removing a non-existing key causes an error`.

The example outputs:
```s
{'cat': 'chat', 'horse': 'cheval'}
```
output

## EXTRA

To remove the last item in a dictionary, you can use the `popitem()` method:
```py
dictionary = {"cat": "chat", "dog": "chien", "horse": "cheval"}

dictionary.popitem()
print(dictionary)    # outputs: {'cat': 'chat', 'dog': 'chien'}
```

In the older versions of Python, i.e., before 3.6.7, the `popitem()` method removes a random item from a dictionary.

# How functions work
Look at the picture below:

It tries to show you the whole process:

  - when you `invoke` a function, Python remembers the place where it happened and jumps into the invoked function;
  - the body of the function is then `executed`;
  - reaching the end of the function forces Python to `return` to the place directly after the point of invocation.

There are two, very important, catches. Here's the first of them:

## You mustn't invoke a function which is not known at the moment of invocation.

Remember - Python reads your code from top to bottom. It's not going to look ahead in order to find a function you forgot to put in the right place ("right" means "before invocation".)

We've inserted an error into this code - can you see the difference?
```py
print("We start here.")
message()
print("We end here.")


def message():
    print("Enter a value: ")
```

We've moved the function to the end of the code. Is Python able to find it when the execution reaches the invocation?

No, it isn't. The error message will read:
```s
NameError: name 'message' is not defined
```

Don't try to force Python to look for functions you didn't deliver at the right time.

The second catch sounds a little simpler:

## You mustn't have a function and a variable of the same name.

The following snippet is erroneous:
```py
def message():
    print("Enter a value: ")

message = 1
```

Assigning a value to the name message causes Python to forget its previous role. The function named `message` becomes unavailable.

Fortunately, you're free to `mix your code with functions` - you're not obliged to put all your functions at the top of your source file.

Look at the snippet:
```py
print("We start here.")


def message():
    print("Enter a value: ")

message()

print("We end here.")
```

It may look strange, but it's completely correct, and works as intended.


Let's return to our primary example, and employ the function for the right job, like here:
```py
def message():
    print("Enter a value: ")

message()
a = int(input())
message()
b = int(input())
message()
c = int(input())
```

Modifying the prompting message is now easy and clear - you can do it by `changing the code in just one place` - inside the function's body.

Open the sandbox, and try to do it yourself.

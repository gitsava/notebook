# Key takeaways
1. An `expression` is a combination of values (or variables, operators, calls to functions - you will learn about them soon) which evaluates to a value, e.g., `1 + 2`.

2. `Operators` are special symbols or keywords which are able to operate on the values and perform (mathematical) operations, e.g., the `*` operator multiplies two values: `x * y`.

3. Arithmetic operators in Python: `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), `/` (classic division - always returns a float), `%` (modulus - divides left operand by right operand and returns the remainder of the operation, e.g., `5 % 2 = 1`), `**` (exponentiation - left operand raised to the power of right operand, e.g., `2 ** 3 = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8`), `//` (floor/integer division - returns a number resulting from division, but rounded down to the nearest whole number, e.g., `3 // 2.0 = 1.0`)

4. A unary operator is an operator with only one operand, e.g., `-1`, or `+3`.

5. A binary operator is an operator with two operands, e.g., `4 + 5`, or `12 % 5`.

6. Some operators act before others - `the hierarchy of priorities`:
  - unary `+` and `-` have the highest priority
  - then: `**`, then: `*`, `/`, and `%`, and then the lowest priority: binary `+` and `-`.

7. Subexpressions in `parentheses` are always calculated first, e.g., `15 - 1 * (5 * (1 + 2)) = 0`.

8. The `exponentiation` operator uses `right-sided binding`, e.g., `2 ** 2 ** 3 = 256`.

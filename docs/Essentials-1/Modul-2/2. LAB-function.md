# LAB

## Estimated time
5-10 minutes

## Level of difficulty
Very easy

## Objectives
  - becoming familiar with the `print()` function and its formatting capabilities;
  - experimenting with Python code.

## Scenario
The `print()` command, which is one of the easiest directives in Python, simply prints out a line to the screen.

In your first lab:

  - use the `print()` function to print the line `Hello, Python!` to the screen. Use double quotes around the string;
  - having done that, use the `print()` function again, but this time print your first name;
  - remove the double quotes and run your code. Watch Python's reaction. What kind of error is thrown?
  - then, remove the parentheses, put back the double quotes, and run your code again. What kind of error is thrown this time?
  - experiment as much as you can. Change double quotes to single quotes, use multiple `print()` functions on the same line, and then on different lines. See what happens.

  ```py
  print("Hello, Python!")
  ```

    "# Accessing files from Python code\n",
    "One of the most common issues in the developer's job is to `process data stored in files` while the files are usually physically stored using storage devices - hard, optical, network, or solid-state disks.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's easy to imagine a program that sorts 20 numbers, and it's equally easy to imagine the user of this program entering these twenty numbers directly from the keyboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's much harder to imagine the same task when there are 20,000 numbers to be sorted, and there isn't a single user who is able to enter these numbers without making a mistake.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's much easier to imagine that these numbers are stored in the disk file which is read by the program. The program sorts the numbers and doesn't send them to the screen, but instead creates a new file and saves the sorted sequence of numbers there.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to implement a simple database, the only way to store the information between program runs is to save it into a file (or files if your database is more complex).\n",
    "\n",
    "In principle, any non-simple programming problem relies on the use of files, whether it processes images (stored in files), multiplies matrices (stored in files), or calculates wages and taxes (reading data stored in files).\n",
    "\n",
    "You may ask why we have waited until now to show you these issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is very simple - Python's way of accessing and processing files is implemented using a consistent set of objects. There is no better moment to talk about it."

    "# File names\n",
    "Different operating systems can treat the files in different ways. For example, Windows uses a different naming convention than the one adopted in Unix/Linux systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we use the notion of a canonical file name (a name which uniquely defines the location of the file regardless of its level in the directory tree) we can realize that these names look different in Windows and in Unix/Linux:\n",
    "#### Windows\n",
    "```s\n",
    "C:\\directory\\file\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Linux\n",
    "```s\n",
    "/directory/file\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, systems derived from Unix/Linux don't use the disk drive letter (e.g., `C:`) and all the directories grow from one root directory called `/`, while Windows systems recognize the root directory as `\\`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, Unix/Linux system file names are case-sensitive. Windows systems store the case of letters used in the file name, but don't distinguish between their cases at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that these two strings: `ThisIsTheNameOfTheFile` and `thisisthenameofthefile` describe two different files in Unix/Linux systems, but are the same name for just one file in Windows systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main and most striking difference is that you have to use `two different separators for the directory names`: `\\` in Windows, and `/` in Unix/Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "This difference is not very important to the normal user, but is `very important when writing programs in Python`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand why, try to recall the very specific role played by the `\\` inside Python strings."

    "Any program written in Python (and not only in Python, because that convention applies to virtually all programming languages) does not communicate with the files directly, but through some abstract entities that are named differently in different languages or environments - the most-used terms are `handles` or `streams` (we'll use them as synonyms here).\n",
    "\n",
    "The programmer, having a more- or less-rich set of functions/methods, is able to perform certain operations on the stream, which affect the real files using mechanisms contained in the operating system kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, you can implement the process of accessing any file, even when the name of the file is unknown at the time of writing the program.\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/pro-file.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "To connect (bind) the stream with the file, it's necessary to perform an explicit operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The operation of connecting the stream with a file is called `opening the file`, while disconnecting this link is named `closing the file`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the conclusion is that the very first operation performed on the stream is always `open` and the last one is `close`. The program, in effect, is free to manipulate the stream between these two events and to handle the associated file.\n",
    "\n",
    "This freedom is limited, of course, by the physical characteristics of the file and the way in which the file has been opened.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us say again that the opening of the stream can fail, and it may happen due to several reasons: the most common is the lack of a file with a specified name.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can also happen that the physical file exists, but the program is not allowed to open it. There's also the risk that the program has opened too many streams, and the specific operating system may not allow the simultaneous opening of more than n files (e.g., 200).\n",
    "\n",
    "A well-written program should detect these failed openings, and react accordingly."

    "If the opening is successful, the `program will be allowed to perform only the operations which are consistent with the declared open mode`.\n",

    "  - `read` from the stream: the portions of the data are retrieved from the file and placed in a memory area managed by the program (e.g., a variable);\n",
    "  - `write` to the stream: the portions of the data from the memory (e.g., a variable) are transferred to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three basic modes used to open the stream:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `read mode`: a stream opened in this mode allows `read operations only`; trying to write to the stream will cause an exception (the exception is named UnsupportedOperation, which inherits OSError and ValueError, and comes from the io module);\n",

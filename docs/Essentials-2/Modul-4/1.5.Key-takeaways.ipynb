    "# Key takeaways\n",
    "1. The `uname` function returns an object that contains information about the current operating system. The object has the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - systemname (stores the name of the operating system)\n",
    "  - nodename (stores the machine name on the network)\n",
    "  - release (stores the operating system release)\n",
    "  - version (stores the operating system version)\n",
    "  - machine (stores the hardware identifier, e.g. x86_64.)\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. The name attribute available in the `os` module allows you to distinguish the operating system. It returns one of the following three values:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - posix (you'll get this name if you use Unix)\n",
    "  - nt (you'll get this name if you use Windows)\n",
    "  - java (you'll get this name if your code is written in something like Jython)\n",
    "  \n",
    "3. The `mkdir` function creates a directory in the path passed as its argument. The path can be either relative or absolute, e.g:\n",
    "```py\n",
    "import os\n",
    "\n",
    "os.mkdir(\"hello\") # the relative path\n",
    "os.mkdir(\"/home/python/hello\") # the absolute path\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note</b>: If the directory exists, a `FileExistsError` exception will be thrown. In addition to the `mkdir` function, the `os` module provides the `makedirs` function, which allows you to recursively create all directories in a path.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The result of the `listdir()` function is a list containing the names of the files and directories that are in the path passed as its argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to remember that the `listdir` function omits the entries '.' and '..', which are displayed, for example, when using the `ls -a` command on Unix systems. If the path isn't passed, the result will be returned for the current working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. To move between directories, you can use a function called `chdir()`, which changes the current working directory to the specified path. As its argument, it takes any relative or absolute path.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to find out what the current working directory is, you can use the `getcwd()` function, which returns the path to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. To remove a directory, you can use the `rmdir()` function, but to remove a directory and its subdirectories, use the `removedirs()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. On both Unix and Windows, you can use the system function, which executes a command passed to it as a string, e.g.:\n",
    "```py\n",
    "import os\n",
    "\n",
    "returned_value = os.system(\"mkdir hello\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The system function on Windows returns the value returned by shell after running the command given, while on Unix it returns the exit status of the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 1\n",
    "What is the output of the following snippet if you run it on Unix?\n",
    "```py\n",
    "import os\n",
    "print(os.name)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A: posix\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 2\n",
    "What is the output of the following snippet?\n",
    "```py\n",
    "import os\n",
    "\n",
    "os.mkdir(\"hello\")\n",
    "print(os.listdir())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A: `['hello']`\n"

    "\n",
    "1. A file needs to be `open` before it can be processed by a program, and it should be `closed` when the processing is finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "Opening the file associates it with the `stream`, which is an abstract representation of the physical data stored on the media. The way in which the stream is processed is called `open mode`. `Three` open modes exist:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `read mode` – only read operations are allowed;\n",
    "  - `write mode` – only write operations are allowed;\n",
    "  - `update mode` – both writes and reads are allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Depending on the physical file content, different Python classes can be used to process files. In general, the `BufferedIOBase` is able to process any file, while `TextIOBase` is a specialized class dedicated to processing text files (i.e. files containing human-visible texts divided into lines using new-line markers). Thus, the streams can be divided into `binary` and `text` ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The following `open()` function syntax is used to open a file:\n",
    "```s\n",
    "open(file_name, mode=open_mode, encoding=text_encoding)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The invocation creates a stream object and associates it with the file named `file_name`, using the specified `open_mode` and setting the specified `text_encoding`, or it `raises an exception in the case of an error`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Three `predefined` streams are already open when the program starts:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `sys.stdin` – standard input;\n",
    "  - `sys.stdout` – standard output;\n",
    "  - `sys.stderr` – standard error output.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The `IOError` exception object, created when any file operations fails (including open operations), contains a property named `errno`, which contains the completion code of the failed action. Use this value to diagnose the problem.\n"

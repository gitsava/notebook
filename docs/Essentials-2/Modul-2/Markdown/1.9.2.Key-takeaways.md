# Key takeaways

1. Strings can be compared to strings using general comparison operators, but comparing them to numbers gives no reasonable result, because `no string can be equal` to any number. For example:

  - `string == number` is always `False`;
  - `string != number` is always `True`;
  - `string >= number` always `raises an exception`.

2. Sorting lists of strings can be done by:

  - a function named `sorted()`, creating a new, sorted list;
  - a method named `sort()`, which sorts the list in situ

3. A number can be converted to a string using the `str()` function.

4. A string can be converted to a number (although not every string) using either the `int()` or `float()` function. The conversion fails if a string doesn't contain a valid number image (an exception is raised then).

## Exercise 1
Which of the following lines describe a `true` condition?
```s
1. 'smith' > 'Smith'
2. 'Smiths' < 'Smith'
3. 'Smith' > '1000'
4. '11' < '8'
```
A: 1, 3 and 4

## Exercise 2
What is the expected output of the following code?
```py
s1 = 'Where are the snows of yesteryear?'
s2 = s1.split()
s3 = sorted(s2)
print(s3[1])
```
A: are

## Exercise 3
What is the expected result of the following code?
```py
s1 = '12.8'
i = int(s1)
s2 = str(i)
f = float(s2)
print(s1 == s2)
```
A: The code raises a `ValueError` exception

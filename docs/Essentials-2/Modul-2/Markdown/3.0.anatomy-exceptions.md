# Exceptions
Python 3 defines `63 built-in exceptions`, and all of them form a `tree-shaped hierarchy`, although the tree is a bit weird as its root is located on top.

Some of the built-in exceptions are more general (they include other exceptions) while others are completely concrete (they represent themselves only). We can say that `the closer to the root an exception is located, the more general (abstract) it is`. In turn, the exceptions located at the branches' ends (we can call them `leaves`) are concrete.

Take a look at the figure:

<img src="img/exception.png">

It shows a small section of the complete exception tree. Let's begin examining the tree from the ZeroDivisionError leaf.

Note:

  - ZeroDivisionError is a special case of more a general exception class named ArithmeticError;
  - ArithmeticError is a special case of a more general exception class named just Exception;
  - Exception is a special case of a more general class named BaseException;

We can describe it in the following way (note the direction of the arrows - they always point to the more general entity):
```s
BaseException
    ↑
Exception
    ↑
ArithmeticError
    ↑
ZeroDivisionError
```

We're going to show you how this generalization works. Let's start with some really simple code.

=====================================================================
# Exceptions: continued
Look at the code in the editor. It is a simple example to start with. Run it.

The output we expect to see looks like this:
```s
Oooppsss...
THE END.
```

Now look at the code below:
```s
try:
    y = 1 / 0
except ArithmeticError:
    print("Oooppsss...")

print("THE END.")
```

Something has changed in it - we've replaced `ZeroDivisionError` with `ArithmeticError`.

You already know that `ArithmeticError` is a general class including (among others) the `ZeroDivisionError` exception.

Thus, the code's output remains unchanged. Test it.

This also means that replacing the exception's name with either Exception or BaseException won't change the program's behavior.

Let's summarize:

  - each exception raised `falls into the first matching branch`;
  - the matching branch doesn't have to specify the same exception exactly - it's enough that the exception is `more general` (more abstract) than the raised one.

=====================================================================
# Exceptions: continued
Look at the code in the editor. What will happen here?
```py
try:
    y = 1 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Zero Division!")
except ArithmeticError:
    print("Arithmetic problem!")

print("THE END.")
```
The first matching branch is the one containing `ZeroDivisionError`. It means that the console will show:
```s
Zero division!
THE END.
```

Will it change anything if we swap the two `except` branches around? Just like here below:
```py
try:
    y = 1 / 0
except ArithmeticError:
    print("Arithmetic problem!")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Zero Division!")

print("THE END.")
```

The change is radical - the code's output is now:
```s
Arithmetic problem!
THE END.
```

Why, if the exception raised is the same as previously?

The exception is the same, but the more general exception is now listed first - it will catch all zero divisions too. It also means that there's no chance that any exception hits the ZeroDivisionError branch. This branch is now completely unreachable.

Remember:

  - the order of the branches matters!
  - don't put more general exceptions before more concrete ones;
  - this will make the latter one unreachable and useless;
  - moreover, it will make your code messy and inconsistent;

Python won't generate any error messages regarding this issue.

=====================================================================
# Exceptions: continued
If you want to handle two or more exceptions in the same way, you can use the following syntax:
```py
try:
    :
except (exc1, exc2):
    :
```

You simply have to put all the engaged exception names into a comma-separated list and not to forget the parentheses.

If an `exception is raised inside a function`, it can be handled:

  - inside the function;
  - outside the function;

Let's start with the first variant - look at the code in the editor.
```py
def bad_fun(n):
    try:
        return 1 / n
    except ArithmeticError:
        print("Arithmetic Problem!")
    return None

bad_fun(0)

print("THE END.")
```
The ZeroDivisionError exception (being a concrete case of the ArithmeticError exception class) is raised inside the `bad_fun()` function, and it doesn't leave the function - the function itself takes care of it.

The program outputs:
```s
Arithmetic problem!
THE END.
```

It's also possible to let the exception propagate `outside the function`. Let's test it now.

Look at the code below:
```py
def bad_fun(n):
    return 1 / n

try:
    bad_fun(0)
except ArithmeticError:
    print("What happened? An exception was raised!")

print("THE END.")
```

The problem has to be solved by the invoker (or by the invoker's invoker, and so on).

The program outputs:
```s
What happened? An exception was raised!
THE END.
```

Note: the `exception raised can cross function and module boundaries`, and travel through the invocation chain looking for a matching `except` clause able to handle it.

If there is no such clause, the exception remains unhandled, and Python solves the problem in its standard way - `by terminating your code and emitting a diagnostic message`.

Now we're going to suspend this discussion, as we want to introduce you to a brand new Python instruction.

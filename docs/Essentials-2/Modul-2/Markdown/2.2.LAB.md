# LAB: Improving the Ceasar cipher
## Estimated time
30-90 minutes

## Level of difficulty
Hard

## Pre-requisites
Module 1.11.1.1, Module 1.11.1.2

## Objectives
improving the student's skills in operating with strings;
converting characters into ASCII code, and vice versa.

## Scenario
You are already familiar with the Caesar cipher, and this is why we want you to improve the code we showed you recently.

The original Caesar cipher shifts each character by one: a becomes b, z becomes a, and so on. Let's make it a bit harder, and allow the shifted value to come from the range 1..25 inclusive.

Moreover, let the code preserve the letters' case (lower-case letters will remain lower-case) and all non-alphabetical characters should remain untouched.

Your task is to write a program which:

  - asks the user for one line of text to encrypt;
  - asks the user for a shift value (an integer number from the range 1..25 - note: you should force the user to enter a valid shift value (don't give up and don't let bad data fool you!)
  - prints out the encoded text.

Test your code using the data we've provided.

# Test data
Sample input:
```s
abcxyzABCxyz 123
2
```

Sample output:
```s
cdezabCDEzab 123
```

Sample input:
```s

Sample output:
```s

# LAB: Palindromes
## Estimated time
15-30 minutes

## Level of difficulty
Easy

## Objectives
  - improving the student's skills in operating with strings;
  - encouraging the student to look for non-obvious solutions.

## Scenario
Do you know what a palindrome is?

It's a word which look the same when read forward and backward. For example, "kayak" is a palindrome, while "loyal" is not.

Your task is to write a program which:

  - asks the user for some text;
  - checks whether the entered text is a palindrome, and prints result.
Note:

  - assume that an empty string isn't a palindrome;
  - treat upper- and lower-case letters as equal;
  - spaces are not taken into account during the check - treat them as non-existent;
  - there are more than a few correct solutions - try to find more than one.

Test your code using the data we've provided.

# Test data
Sample input:
```s
Ten animals I slam in a net
```
Sample output:
```s
It's a palindrome
```

Sample input:
```s
Eleven animals I slam in a net
```
Sample output:
```s
It's not a palindrome
```

# LAB: Anagrams
## Estimated time
30-60 minutes

## Level of difficulty
Easy

## Objectives
  - improving the student's skills in operating with strings;
  - converting strings into lists, and vice versa.

## Scenario
An anagram is a new word formed by rearranging the letters of a word, using all the original letters exactly once. For example, the phrases "rail safety" and "fairy tales" are anagrams, while "I am" and "You are" are not.

Your task is to write a program which:

  - asks the user for two separate texts;
  - checks whether, the entered texts are anagrams and prints the result.

Note:

  - assume that two empty strings are not anagrams;
  - treat upper- and lower-case letters as equal;
  - spaces are not taken into account during the check - treat them as non-existent

Test your code using the data we've provided.

# Test data
Sample input:
```s
Listen
Silent
```
Sample output:
```s
Anagrams
```

Sample input:
```s
modern
norman
```
Sample output:
```s
Not anagrams
```

# LAB: The Digit of Life
## Estimated time
15-30 minutes

## Level of difficulty
Easy

## Objectives
  - improving the student's skills in operating with strings;
  - converting integers into strings, and vice versa.

## Scenario
Some say that the Digit of Life is a digit evaluated using somebody's birthday. It's simple - you just need to sum all the digits of the date. If the result contains more than one digit, you have to repeat the addition until you get exactly one digit. For example:

  - 1 January 2017 = 2017 01 01
  - 2 + 0 + 1 + 7 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 12
  - 1 + 2 = 3

3 is the digit we searched for and found.

Your task is to write a program which:

  - asks the user her/his birthday (in the format YYYYMMDD, or YYYYDDMM, or MMDDYYYY - actually, the order of the digits doesn't matter)
  - outputs the Digit of Life for the date.

Test your code using the data we've provided.

# Test data

```s

Sample output:

# LAB: Find a word!
## Estimated time
30-45 minutes

## Level of difficulty
Medium

## Objectives
  - improving the student's skills in operating with strings;
  - using the `find()` method for searching strings.

## Scenario
Let's play a game. We will give you two strings: one being a word (e.g., "dog") and the second being a combination of any characters.

Your task is to write a program which answers the following question: `are the characters comprising the first string hidden inside the second string?`

For example:

  - if the second string is given as "vcxzxduybfdsobywuefgas", the answer is `yes`;
  - if the second string is "vcxzxdcybfdstbywuefsas", the answer is `no` (as there are neither the letters "d", "o", or "g", in this order)

Hints:

  - you should use the two-argument variants of the `pos()` functions inside your code;
  - don't worry about case sensitivity.

Test your code using the data we've provided.

# Test data
Sample input:
```s
donor
Nabucodonosor
```

Sample output:
```s
Yes
```

Sample input:
```s
donut
Nabucodonosor
```

Sample output:
```s
No
```

# LAB: Sudoku
## Estimated time
60-90 minutes

## Level of difficulty
Hard

## Objectives
  - improving the student's skills in operating with strings and lists;
  - converting strings into lists.

## Scenario
As you probably know, Sudoku is a number-placing puzzle played on a 9x9 board. The player has to fill the board in a very specific way:

  - each row of the board must contain all digits from 0 to 9 (the order doesn't matter)
  - each column of the board must contain all digits from 0 to 9 (again, the order doesn't matter)
  - each of the nine 3x3 "tiles" (we will name them "sub-squares") of the table must contain all digits from 0 to 9.

If you need more details, you can find them here.

Your task is to write a program which:

  - reads 9 rows of the Sudoku, each containing 9 digits (check carefully if the data entered are valid)
  - outputs `Yes` if the Sudoku is valid, and `No` otherwise.

Test your code using the data we've provided.

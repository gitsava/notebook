    "1. A `class` is an idea (more or less abstract) which can be used to create a number of incarnations – such an incarnation is called an `object`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When a class is derived from another class, their relation is named `inheritance`. The class which derives from the other class is named a `subclass`. The second side of this relation is named `superclass`. A way to present such a relation is an `inheritance diagram`, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - superclasses are always presented `above` their subclasses;\n",
    "  - relations between classes are shown as arrows directed `from the subclass toward its superclass`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Objects are equipped with:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - a `name` which identifies them and allows us to distinguish between them;\n",
    "  - a set of `properties` (the set can be empty)\n",
    "  - a set of `methods` (can be empty, too)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. To define a Python class, you need to use the `class` keyword. For example:\n",
    "```py\n",
    "class This_Is_A_Class:\n",
    "     pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. To create an object of the previously defined class, you need to use the class as if it were a function. For example:\n",
    "```py\n",
    "this_is_an_object = This_Is_A_Class()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 1\n",
    "If we assume that pythons, vipers, and cobras are subclasses of the same superclass, how would you call it?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: Snake, reptile, vertebrate, animal – all these answers are acceptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 2\n",
    "Try to name a few python class subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "A: Indian python, African rock python, ball python, Burmese python – the list is long.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 3\n",
    "Can you name one of your classes just \"class\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: No, you can't – class is a keyword!\n"

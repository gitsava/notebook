# What is Method Resolution Order (MRO) and why is it that not all inheritances make sense?
MRO, in general, is a way (you can call it a `strategy`) in which a particular programming language scans through the upper part of a class’s hierarchy in order to find the method it currently needs. It's worth emphasizing that different languages use slightly (or even completely) different MROs. Python is a unique creature in this respect, however, and its customs are a bit specific.

We're going to show you how Python's MRO works in two peculiar cases that are clear-cut examples of problems which may occur when you try to use multiple inheritance too recklessly. Let's start with a snippet that initially may look simple. Look at what we've prepared for you in the editor.
```py
class Top:
    def m_top(self):
        print("top")


class Middle(Top):
    def m_middle(self):
        print("middle")


class Bottom(Middle):
    def m_bottom(self):
        print("bottom")


object = Bottom()
object.m_bottom()
object.m_middle()
object.m_top()
```

We're sure that if you analyze the snippet yourself, you won't see any anomalies in it. Yes, you're perfectly right - it looks clear and simple, and raises no concerns. If you run the code, it will produce the following, predictable output:
```s
bottom
middle
top
```

No surprises so far. Let's make a tiny change to this code. Have a look:
```py
class Top:
    def m_top(self):
        print("top")


class Middle(Top):
    def m_middle(self):
        print("middle")


class Bottom(Middle, Top):
    def m_bottom(self):
        print("bottom")


object = Bottom()
object.m_bottom()
object.m_middle()
object.m_top()
```

Can you see the difference? It's hidden in this line:
```py
class Bottom(Middle, Top):
```

In this exotic way, we've turned a very simple code with a clear single-inheritance path into a mysterious multiple-inheritance riddle. “Is it valid?” you may ask. Yes, it is. “How is that possible?” you should ask now, and we hope that you really feel the need to ask this question.

As you can see, the order in which the two superclasses have been listed between parenthesis is compliant with the code's structure: the `Middle` class precedes the `Top` class, just like in the real inheritance path.

Despite its oddity, the sample is correct and works as expected, but it has to be stated that this notation doesn’t bring any new functionality or additional meaning.

Let's modify the code once again - now we'll swap both superclass names in the `Bottom` class definition. This is what the snippet looks like now:
```py
class Top:
    def m_top(self):
        print("top")


class Middle(Top):
    def m_middle(self):
        print("middle")


class Bottom(Top, Middle):
    def m_bottom(self):
        print("bottom")


object = Bottom()
object.m_bottom()
object.m_middle()
object.m_top()
```

To anticipate your question, we’ll say that this amendment has spoiled the code, and it won't run anymore. What a pity. The order we tried to force (Top, Middle) is incompatible with the inheritance path which is derived from the code's structure. Python won't like it. This is what we'll see:
```s
TypeError: Cannot create a consistent method resolution order (MRO) for bases Top, Middle
```

We think that the message speaks for itself. Python's MRO cannot be bent or violated, not just because that's the way Python works, but also because it’s a rule you have to obey.

=============================================================================
# The diamond problem
The second example of the spectrum of issues that can possibly arise from multiple inheritance is illustrated by a classic problem named the `diamond problem`. The name reflects the shape of the inheritance diagram - take a look at the picture:

<img src="img/oop11.png">

  - There is the top-most superclass named A;
  - there are two subclasses derived from A: B and C;
  - and there is also the bottom-most subclass named D, derived from B and C (or C and B, as these two variants mean different things in Python)

Can you see the diamond there?

Have a look at the code in the editor. The same structure, but expressed in Python.

Some programming languages forbid multiple inheritance at all, and as a consequence, they won't let you build a diamond - this is the route that Java and C# have chosen to follow since their origins.

Python, however, has chosen a different route - it allows multiple inheritance, and it doesn't mind if you write and run code like the one in the editor. But don't forget about MRO - it's always in charge.
```py
class A:
    pass


class B(A):
    pass


class C(A):
    pass


class D(B, C):
    pass


d = D()
```

Let's rebuild our example from the previous page to make it more diamond-like, just like below:
```py
class Top:
    def m_top(self):
        print("top")


class Middle_Left(Top):
    def m_middle(self):
        print("middle_left")


class Middle_Right(Top):
    def m_middle(self):
        print("middle_right")


class Bottom(Middle_Left, Middle_Right):
    def m_bottom(self):
        print("bottom")


object = Bottom()
object.m_bottom()
object.m_middle()
object.m_top()
```

Note: both `Middle` classes define `a method of the same name: m_middle()`.

It introduces a small uncertainty to our sample, although we're absolutely sure that you can answer the following key question: which of the two `m_middle()` methods will actually be invoked when the following line is executed?
```py
Object.m_middle()
```

In other words, what will you see on the screen: `middle_left` or `middle_right`?

You don't need to hurry – think twice and keep Python's MRO in mind!

Are you ready?

Yes, you're right. The invocation will activate the `m_middle()` method, which comes from the `Middle_Left` class. The explanation is simple: the class is listed before `Middle_Right` on the `Bottom` class's inheritance list. If you want to make sure that there’s no doubt about it, try to swap these two classes on the list and check the results.

If you want to experience some more profound impressions about multiple inheritance and precious gemstones, try to modify our snippet and equip the `Upper` class with another specimen of the `m_middle()` method, and investigate its behavior carefully.

As you can see, diamonds may bring some problems into your life – both the real ones and those offered by Python.

# LAB: Queue aka FIFO
## Estimated time
20-45 minutes

## Level of difficulty
Easy/Medium

## Objectives

  - improving the student's skills in defining classes from scratch;
  - implementing standard data structures as classes.

## Scenario

As you already know, a stack is a data structure realizing the so-called LIFO (Last In - First Out) model. It's easy and you've already grown perfectly accustomed to it.

Let's taste something new now. A queue is a data model characterized by the term `FIFO: First In - Fist Out`. Note: a regular queue (line) you know from shops or post offices works exactly in the same way - a customer who came first is served first too.

Your task is to implement the `Queue` class with two basic operations:

  - `put(element)`, which puts an element at end of the queue;
  - `get()`, which takes an element from the front of the queue and returns it as the result (the queue cannot be empty to successfully perform it.)

Follow the hints:

  - use a list as your storage (just like we did in stack)
  - `put()` should append elements to the beginning of the list, while `get()` should remove the elements from the list's end;
  - define a new exception named `QueueError` (choose an exception to derive it from) and raise it when `get()` tries to operate on an empty list.

Complete the code we've provided in the editor. Run it to check whether its output is similar to ours.

## Expected output
```s
1
dog
False
Queue error
```
```py
class QueueError(???):  # Choose base class for the new exception.
    #
    #  Write code here
    #


class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        #
        # Write code here
        #

    def put(self, elem):
        #
        # Write code here
        #

    def get(self):
        #
        # Write code here
        #


que = Queue()
que.put(1)
que.put("dog")
que.put(False)
try:
    for i in range(4):
        print(que.get())
except:
    print("Queue error")
```

# LAB: Queue aka FIFO
## Estimated time
15-30 minutes

## Level of difficulty
Easy/Medium

## Objectives
  - improving the student's skills in defining subclasses;
  - adding a new functionality to an existing class.

## Scenario
Your task is to slightly extend the `Queue` class' capabilities. We want it to have a parameterless method that returns True if the queue is empty and False otherwise.

Complete the code we've provided in the editor. Run it to check whether it outputs a similar result to ours.
```py
class QueueError(???):
    pass


class Queue:
    #
    # Code from the previous lab.
    #


class SuperQueue(Queue):
    #
    # Write new code here.
    #


que = SuperQueue()
que.put(1)
que.put("dog")
que.put(False)
for i in range(4):
    if not que.isempty():
        print(que.get())
    else:
        print("Queue empty")

```
Below you can copy the code we used in the previous lab:
```py
class QueueError(IndexError):
    pass


class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.queue = []
    def put(self,elem):
        self.queue.insert(0,elem)
    def get(self):
        if len(self.queue) > 0:
            elem = self.queue[-1]
            del self.queue[-1]
            return elem
        else:
            raise QueueError
```

## Expected output
```s
1
dog
False
Queue empty
```

# Key takeaways

1. A `stack` is an object designed to store data using the `LIFO` model. The stack usually accomplishes at least two operations, named `push()` and `pop()`.


2. Implementing the stack in a procedural model raises several problems which can be solved by the techniques offered by `OOP (Object Oriented Programming)`:


3. A class `method` is actually a function declared inside the class and able to access all the class's components.


4. The part of the Python class responsible for creating new objects is called the `constructor`, and it's implemented as a method of the name `__init__`.


5. Each class method declaration must contain at least one parameter (always the first one) usually referred to as `self`, and is used by the objects to identify themselves.


6. If we want to hide any of a class's components from the outside world, we should start its name with `__`. Such components are called `private`.

## Exercise 1
Assuming that there is a class named `Snakes`, write the very first line of the `Python` class declaration, expressing the fact that the new class is actually a subclass of Snake.
A: class Python(Snakes):

## Exercise 2
Something is missing from the following declaration â€“ what?
```py
class Snakes
    def __init__():
        self.sound = 'Sssssss'
```
A: The `__init__()` constructor lacks the obligatory parameter (we should name it `self` to stay compliant with the standards).

## Exercise 3
Modify the code to guarantee that the `venomous` property is private.
```py
class Snakes
    def __init__(self):
        self.venomous = True
```		
A: The code should look as follows:
   ```py
	class Snakes
	    def __init__(self):
	        self.__venomous = True
   ```

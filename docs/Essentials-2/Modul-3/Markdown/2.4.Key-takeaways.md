# Key takeaways

1. The `else:` branch of the `try` statement is executed when there has been no exception during the execution of the `try:` block.


2. The `finally:` branch of the `try` statement is `always` executed.


3. The syntax `except Exception_Name as an exception_object:` lets you intercept an object carrying information about a pending exception. The object's property named `args` (a tuple) stores all arguments passed to the object's constructor.


4. The exception classes can be extended to enrich them with new capabilities, or to adopt their traits to newly defined exceptions.

For example:
```py
try:
    assert __name__ == "__main__"
except:
    print("fail", end=' ')
else:
    print("success", end=' ')
finally:
    print("done")
```

The code outputs: `success done`.

## Exercise 1
What is the expected output of the following code?
```py
import math

try:
    print(math.sqrt(9))
except ValueError:
    print("inf")
else:
    print("fine")
```
A:
```s
3.0
fine
```

## Exercise 2
What is the expected output of the following code?
```py
import math

try:
    print(math.sqrt(-9))
except ValueError:
    print("inf")
else:
    print("fine")
finally:
    print("the end")
```
A:
```s
inf
the end
```

## Exercise 3
What is the expected output of the following code?
```py
import math

class NewValueError(ValueError):
    def __init__(self, name, color, state):
        self.data = (name, color, state)

try:
    raise NewValueError("Enemy warning", "Red alert", "High readiness")
except NewValueError as nve:
    for arg in nve.args:
        print(arg, end='! ')
```
A: 
```s
Enemy warning! Red alert! High readiness! 
```

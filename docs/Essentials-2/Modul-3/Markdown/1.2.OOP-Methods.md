# The inner life of classes and objects: continued
`__dict__` is a dictionary. Another built-in property worth mentioning is `__name__`, which is a string.

The property contains `the name of the class`. It's nothing exciting, just a string.

Note: the `__name__` attribute is absent from the object - `it exists only inside classes`.


If you want to `find the class of a particular object`, you can use a function named `type()`, which is able (among other things) to find a class which has been used to instantiate any object.

Look at the code in the editor, run it, and see for yourself.
```py
class Classy:
    pass


print(Classy.__name__)
obj = Classy()
print(type(obj).__name__)
```
The code outputs:
```s
Classy
Classy
```

Note that a statement like this one:
```py
print(obj.__name__)
```

will cause an error.

============================================================================
# The inner life of classes and objects: continued
`__module__` is a string, too - it `stores the name of the module which contains the definition of the class`.

Let's check it - run the code in the editor.
```py
class Classy:
    pass


print(Classy.__module__)
obj = Classy()
print(obj.__module__)
```
The code outputs:
```s
__main__
__main__
```

As you know, any module named `__main__` is actually not a module, but the `file currently being run`.

============================================================================
# The inner life of classes and objects: continued
`__bases__` is a tuple. The `tuple contains classes` (not class names) which are direct superclasses for the class.

The order is the same as that used inside the class definition.

We'll show you only a very basic example, as we want to highlight `how inheritance works`.

Moreover, we're going to show you how to use this attribute when we discuss the objective aspects of exceptions.

Note: `only classes have this attribute` - objects don't.

We've defined a function named `printbases()`, designed to present the tuple's contents clearly.

Look at the code in the editor. Analyze it and run it. It will output:
```py
class SuperOne:
    pass


class SuperTwo:
    pass


class Sub(SuperOne, SuperTwo):
    pass


def printBases(cls):
    print('( ', end='')

    for x in cls.__bases__:
        print(x.__name__, end=' ')
    print(')')


printBases(SuperOne)
printBases(SuperTwo)
printBases(Sub)
```
```s
( object )
( object )
( SuperOne SuperTwo )
```

Note: a `class without explicit superclasses points to object` (a predefined Python class) as its direct ancestor.

=====================================================================
# Reflection and introspection
All these means allow the Python programmer to perform two important activities specific to many objective languages. They are:

  - `introspection`, which is the ability of a program to examine the type or properties of an object at runtime;
  - `reflection`, which goes a step further, and is the ability of a program to manipulate the values, properties and/or functions of an object at runtime.

In other words, you don't have to know a complete class/object definition to manipulate the object, as the object and/or its class contain the metadata allowing you to recognize its features during program execution.

======================================================================
# Investigating classes
What can you find out about classes in Python? The answer is simple - everything.

Both reflection and introspection enable a programmer to do anything with every object, no matter where it comes from.

Analyze the the code in the editor.
```py
class MyClass:
    pass


obj = MyClass()
obj.a = 1
obj.b = 2
obj.i = 3
obj.ireal = 3.5
obj.integer = 4
obj.z = 5


def incIntsI(obj):
    for name in obj.__dict__.keys():
        if name.startswith('i'):
            val = getattr(obj, name)
            if isinstance(val, int):
                setattr(obj, name, val + 1)


print(obj.__dict__)
incIntsI(obj)
print(obj.__dict__)
```
The function named `incIntsI()` gets an object of any class, scans its contents in order to find all integer attributes with names starting with i, and increments them by one.

Impossible? Not at all!

This is how it works:

  - line 1: define a very simple class...
  - lines 3 through 10: ... and fill it with some attributes;
  - line 12: this is our function!
  - line 13: scan the `__dict__` attribute, looking for all attribute names;
  - line 14: if a name starts with i...
  - line 15: ... use the `getattr()` function to get its current value; note: `getattr()` takes two arguments: an object, and its property name (as a string), and returns the current attribute's value;
  - line 16: check if the value is of type integer, and use the function `isinstance()` for this purpose (we'll discuss this later);
  - line 17: if the check goes well, increment the property's value by making use of the `setattr()` function; the function takes three arguments: an object, the property name (as a string), and the property's new value.

The code outputs:
```s
{'a': 1, 'integer': 4, 'b': 2, 'i': 3, 'z': 5, 'ireal': 3.5}
{'a': 1, 'integer': 5, 'b': 2, 'i': 4, 'z': 5, 'ireal': 3.5}
```

That's all!

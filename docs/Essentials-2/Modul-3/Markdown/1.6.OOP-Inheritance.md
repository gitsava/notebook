# Inheritance - why and how?
Before we start talking about inheritance, we want to present a new, handy mechanism utilized by Python's classes and objects - it's `the way in which the object is able to introduce itself`.

Let's start with an example. Look at the code in the editor.
```py
class Star:
    def __init__(self, name, galaxy):
        self.name = name
        self.galaxy = galaxy


sun = Star("Sun", "Milky Way")
print(sun)
```

The program prints out just one line of text, which in our case is this:
```s
<__main__.Star object at 0x7f1074cc7c50>
```

If you run the same code on your computer, you'll see something very similar, although the hexadecimal number (the substring starting with 0x) will be different, as it's just an internal object identifier used by Python, and it's unlikely that it would appear the same when the same code is run in a different environment.

As you can see, the printout here isn't really useful, and something more specific, or just prettier, may be more preferable.

Fortunately, Python offers just such a function.

=============================================================================
# Inheritance - why and how?
When Python needs any class/object to be presented as a string (putting an object as an argument in the `print()` function invocation fits this condition) it tries to invoke a method named `__str__()` from the object and to use the string it returns.

The default `__str__()` method returns the previous string - ugly and not very informative. You can change it just by `defining your own method of the name`.

We've just done it - look at the code in the editor.

This new `__str__()` method makes a string consisting of the star's and galaxy's names - nothing special, but the print results look better now, doesn't it?
```py
class Star:
    def __init__(self, name, galaxy):
        self.name = name
        self.galaxy = galaxy

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name + ' in ' + self.galaxy


sun = Star("Sun", "Milky Way")
print(sun)
```

Can you guess the output? Run the code to check if you were right.

=============================================================================
# Inheritance - why and how?
The term inheritance is older than computer programming, and it describes the common practice of passing different goods from one person to another upon that person's death. The term, when related to computer programming, has an entirely different meaning.

<img src="img/oop8.png">

Let's define the term for our purposes:

Inheritance is a common practice (in object programming) of `passing attributes and methods from the superclass (defined and existing) to a newly created class, called the subclass`.

In other words, inheritance is `a way of building a new class, not from scratch, but by using an already defined repertoire of traits`. The new class inherits (and this is the key) all the already existing equipment, but is able to add some new ones if needed.

Thanks to that, it's possible to `build more specialized (more concrete) classes` using some sets of predefined general rules and behaviors.

The most important factor of the process is the relation between the superclass and all of its subclasses (note: if B is a subclass of A and C is a subclass of B, this also means than C is a subclass of A, as the relationship is fully transitive).

A very simple example of `two-level inheritance` is presented here:
```py
class Vehicle:
    pass


class LandVehicle(Vehicle):
    pass


class TrackedVehicle(LandVehicle):
    pass
```

All the presented classes are empty for now, as we're going to show you how the mutual relations between the super- and subclasses work. We'll fill them with contents soon.

We can say that:

  - The `Vehicle` class is the superclass for both the `LandVehicle` and `TrackedVehicle` classes;
  - The `LandVehicle` class is a subclass of `Vehicle` and a superclass of `TrackedVehicle` at the same time;
  - The `TrackedVehicle` class is a subclass of both the `Vehicle` and `LandVehicle` classes.

The above knowledge comes from reading the code (in other words, we know it because we can see it).

Does Python know the same? Is it possible to ask Python about it? Yes, it is.

=============================================================================
# Inheritance: issubclass()
Python offers a function which is able to `identify a relationship between two classes`, and although its diagnosis isn't complex, it can `check if a particular class is a subclass of any other class`.

This is how it looks:
```py
issubclass(ClassOne, ClassTwo)
```

The function returns True if `ClassOne` is a subclass of `ClassTwo`, and False otherwise.

Let's see it in action - it may surprise you. Look at the code in the editor. Read it carefully.
```py
class Vehicle:
    pass


class LandVehicle(Vehicle):
    pass


class TrackedVehicle(LandVehicle):
    pass


for cls1 in [Vehicle, LandVehicle, TrackedVehicle]:
    for cls2 in [Vehicle, LandVehicle, TrackedVehicle]:
        print(issubclass(cls1, cls2), end="\t")
    print()
```

There are two nested loops. Their purpose is to `check all possible ordered pairs of classes, and to print the results of the check to determine whether the pair matches the subclass-superclass relationship`.

Run the code. The program produces the following output:
```s
True	False	False	
True	True	False	
True	True	True	
```

Let's make the result more readable:

There is one important observation to make: `each class is considered to be a subclass of itself`.

=============================================================================
# Inheritance: isinstance()
As you already know, `an object is an incarnation of a class`. This means that the object is like a cake baked using a recipe which is included inside the class.

This can generate some important issues.

Let's assume that you've got a cake (e.g., as an argument passed to your function). You want to know what recipe has been used to make it. Why? Because you want to know what to expect from it, e.g., whether it contains nuts or not, which is crucial information to some people.

Similarly, it can be crucial if the object does have (or doesn't have) certain characteristics. In other words, `whether it is an object of a certain class or not`.

Such a fact could be detected by the function named `isinstance()`:
```py
isinstance(objectName, ClassName)
```

The functions returns True if the object is an instance of the class, or False otherwise.

`Being an instance of a class means that the object (the cake) has been prepared using a recipe contained in either the class or one of its superclasses`.

Don't forget: if a subclass contains at least the same equipment as any of its superclasses, it means that objects of the subclass can do the same as objects derived from the superclass, ergo, it's an instance of its home class and any of its superclasses.

Let's test it. Analyze the code in the editor.
```py
class Vehicle:
    pass


class LandVehicle(Vehicle):
    pass


class TrackedVehicle(LandVehicle):
    pass


my_vehicle = Vehicle()
my_land_vehicle = LandVehicle()
my_tracked_vehicle = TrackedVehicle()

for obj in [my_vehicle, my_land_vehicle, my_tracked_vehicle]:
    for cls in [Vehicle, LandVehicle, TrackedVehicle]:
        print(isinstance(obj, cls), end="\t")
    print()
```
We've created three objects, one for each of the classes. Next, using two nested loops, we check all possible object-class pairs `to find out if the objects are instances of the classes`.

Run the code.

This is what we get:
```s
True	False	False	
True	True	False	
True	True	True	
```

Let's make the result more readable once again:

Does the table confirm our expectations?

# LAB: The Timer class
## Estimated time
30-60 minutes

## Level of difficulty
Easy/Medium

## Objectives
  - improving the student's skills in defining classes from scratch;
  - defining and using instance variables;
  - defining and using methods.

## Scenario
We need a class able to count seconds. Easy? Not as much as you may think as we're going to have some specific expectations.

Read them carefully as the class you're about write will be used to launch rockets carrying international missions to Mars. It's a great responsibility. We're counting on you!

Your class will be called `Timer`. Its constructor accepts three arguments representing `hours` (a value from range [0..23] - we will be using the military time), `minutes` (from range [0..59]) and `seconds` (from range [0..59]).

Zero is the default value for all of the above parameters. There is no need to perform any validation checks.

The class itself should provide the following facilities:

  - objects of the class should be "printable", i.e. they should be able to implicitly convert themselves into strings of the following form: "hh:mm:ss", with leading zeros added when any of the values is less than 10;
  - the class should be equipped with parameterless methods called `next_second()` and `previous_second()`, incrementing the time stored inside objects by +1/-1 second respectively.

Use the following hints:

  - all object's properties should be private;
  - consider writing a separate function (not method!) to format the time string.

Complete the template we've provided in the editor. Run your code and check whether the output looks the same as ours.
```py
class Timer:
    def __init__( ??? ):
        #
        # Write code here
        #

    def __str__(self):
        #
        # Write code here
        #

    def next_second(self):
        #
        # Write code here
        #

    def prev_second(self):
        #
        # Write code here
        #


timer = Timer(23, 59, 59)
print(timer)
timer.next_second()
print(timer)
timer.prev_second()
print(timer)
```

# Expected output
```s
23:59:59
00:00:00
23:59:59
```

# LAB: Days of the week
## Estimated time
30-60 minutes

## Level of difficulty
Easy/Medium

## Objectives
  - improving the student's skills in defining classes from scratch;
  - defining and using instance variables;
  - defining and using methods.

## Scenario
Your task is to implement a class called Weeker. Yes, your eyes don't deceive you - this name comes from the fact that objects of that class will be able to store and to manipulate days of a week.

The class constructor accepts one argument - a string. The string represents the name of the day of the week and the only acceptable values must come from the following set:

Mon Thu Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun

Invoking the constructor with an argument from outside this set should raise the WeekDayError exception (define it yourself; don't worry, we'll talk about the objective nature of exceptions soon). The class should provide the following facilities:

  - objects of the class should be "printable", i.e. they should be able to implicitly convert themselves into strings of the same form as the constructor arguments;
  - the class should be equipped with one-parameter methods called `add_days(n)` and `subtract_days(n)`, with n being an integer number and updating the day of week stored inside the object in the way reflecting the change of date by the indicated number of days, forward or backward.
  - all object's properties should be private;

Complete the template we've provided in the editor and run your code and check whether your output looks the same as ours.
```py
class WeekDayError(Exception):
    pass
	

class Weeker:
    #
    # Write code here
    #

    def __init__(self, day):
        #
        # Write code here
        #

    def __str__(self):
        #
        # Write code here
        #

    def add_days(self, n):
        #
        # Write code here
        #

    def subtract_days(self, n):
        #
        # Write code here
        #


try:
    weekday = Weeker('Mon')
    print(weekday)
    weekday.add_days(15)
    print(weekday)
    weekday.subtract_days(23)
    print(weekday)
    weekday = Weeker('Monday')
except WeekDayError:
    print("Sorry, I can't serve your request.")
```
## Expected output
```s
Mon
Thu
Sun
Sorry, I can't serve your request.
```
